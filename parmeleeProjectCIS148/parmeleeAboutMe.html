        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <article>
        <p>I was very lucky to grow up in Southern California. During the day, I played wiffle ball
            and rode scooters in my backyard. At night, I would check on my Neopets and try to
            beat the hardest bosses in Final Fantasy. Our neighborhood was perfect to me. Everyone
            knew each other and we hung out as a crowd. Yearly, we would have a table tennis tournament.
            It was perfect.
        </p>
        <p>After graduating from San Clemente High School (and beating Dana Hills in tennis my senior year,
            in your face Dolphins!), I went to USC. But not that USC. University of South Carolina. It was a wild
            ride, balancing school and how to be an elementary school teacher with football games and meeting
             new people. Before my senior year, I embarked on a road trip with my friend, Haley. It was officially 
             a journey for our senior thesis, but it became a journey that would change our lives forever.
        </p>
        <p>The road trip took us from South Carolina, along the southern coast of the United States, to California.
            Along the way, we used <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a>, a free way to stay in and explore
            a city. We also camped in National and State Parks, stayed with family, and occasionally had to get a hotel.
            After meeting up with my family in San Clemente, we went up the west coast. 
        </p>
        <p>It was at this point where Haley and I fell in love. Again, my life was picturesque. It was also at this point where
            we got a call from our college dorm that they could reimburse us for some of the gas! We continued from Seattle across 
            the northern highways to Detroit. From there, we took a little detour up to Toronto and back through Niagara Falls.
            Our journey ended and we defended our thesis in front of everyone who supported us throughout.
        </p>
        <p>This trip propelled our lives forward. Haley used the last semester of her senior year to intern in Washington D.C. and
            I found a job teaching 4th grade just outside the city limits in Maryland. Our seven years in D.C. included 
            <a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/weather/a-timeline-of-the-snowiest-blizzards-in-dc-maryland-and-virginia-history-snow-2016-2003-1996-blizzard">
                the snowiest Blizzard in the history of D.C.</a>, getting married, and adopting two beautiful and mischievous cats.

        </p>
        <p>Since moving to California, I have rediscovered myself. I did not know I could be as happy as I am now that I live
            in Los Angeles. I hope to one day give back to L.A. in a way that is proportional. Since deciding to change careers, I
            have explored different ways to do that. I am hoping to start by sharing my love of L.A. with people who visit, then eventually
            working for the county or city in some capacity.

        <h1>Our Cats</h1>
        <article>
        <p>We have two incredible cats named Penelope and Fried Pickles. We adopted them in Wasginton D.C. 
            a few days before my birthday. Penelope is a trouble maker who loves to get pet at all costs.
            Fried Pickles is a good boy that does not like to break the rules, but loves to play with his toys
            until they break.
